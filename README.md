# Personalized Customer Support Orchestrator (B2C Agentic Workflow)

This project is a **functional no-code prototype** of a B2C agentic workflow designed to automate customer support for **e-commerce** and **SaaS** businesses.  
Built using **Microsoft CoPilot Studio**, it demonstrates how an AI agent can connect to live business systems to provide **personalized, actionable support** and intelligently escalate complex issues to human agents.

## Problem Statement
E-commerce and SaaS businesses are facing:
- **Rising customer support costs**  
- **Slow resolution times** for common inquiries (e.g., *"Where is my order?"*)  

👉 Standard chatbots fail because they lack:  
1. **Personalization** – no access to user-specific backend data.  
2. **Actionability** – cannot perform tasks for the user.  

This leads to **customer frustration**, **high operational overhead**, and a **poor user experience**.

---

## Solution Overview
The **Personalized Customer Support Orchestrator** is an intelligent AI agent that:  
- Provides **instant, 24/7 support** by integrating directly with core business systems.  
- Resolves the **majority of tier-1 support requests** (order tracking, refunds, product questions).  
- Seamlessly escalates complex cases to **human agents** with full context.  

✨ Benefits:
- Lower operational costs  
- Faster resolutions  
- Improved **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**  

---

## How It Works: The Agentic Workflow
The AI agent follows a structured workflow:

1. **Triage** – Understands the customer’s intent (order status, product info, refund request).  
2. **Tool Use** – Executes the correct action:  
   - **Order inquiries** → Calls **Shopify API** for real-time shipping updates.  
   - **General questions** → Uses **RAG search** on Zendesk knowledge base.  
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Escalation** – If unresolved:  
   - Detects frustration or repeated failures.  
   - Creates a **Zendesk ticket** with the full conversation + summary.  
   - Passes context to a human agent for a **seamless handoff**.  

---

## No-Code Prototype
A **fully functional chatbot prototype** was built using a no-code AI agent builder to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow and validate the concept.

---

## Technology Stack
- **No-Code AI Agent Builder**: Microsoft CoPilot Studio  
- **E-commerce Platform**: Shopify (developer account for order data)  
- **Support System & Knowledge Base**: Zendesk (trial account for ticketing + RAG)  

---

## Live Demo & Walkthrough
👉 *(Add links once available)*  

- **Live Demo Link**: [Link to deployed chatbot]  
- **Video Walkthrough**: ``  

**Recommended demo flows**:  
1. **Order Status** → Show Shopify integration.  
2. **Escalation** → Trigger a handoff to a human via Zendesk.

## Product Management Artifacts

### 1. Product One-Pager
**Problem**: Businesses struggle with high support costs and poor CSAT due to chatbots that lack personalization + actionability.  

**Solution**: An AI agent integrated with **Shopify** and **Zendesk** to automate >60% of tier-1 tickets while escalating complex cases seamlessly.  

**Target Audience**: Customer support teams & operations managers at e-commerce and SaaS firms.  

**Business Impact**:
- **60% automation rate** → reduced support costs.  
- **<2 min average resolution time** → faster customer support.  
- Improved **CSAT ≥ 4.5/5** → happier customers.

### 2. Product Positioning Map
📊 *Visualize competitive positioning (create in Figma/Miro).*  

**Axes**:  
- X = **Level of Autonomy** (Low → High)  
- Y = **Level of Personalization** (Low → High)  

**Our Position**: Top-right quadrant → **High Autonomy + High Personalization**.  
- Unlike standard chatbots (low/low).  
- Unlike humans (high personalization, but not autonomous).

### 3. Success Metrics (KPIs)
| Goal | Metric (KPI) | Target (MVP) |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Increase Efficiency | Automation Rate (% conversations resolved by AI) | **60%** |
| Improve UX | Human Escalation Rate (% requiring humans) | **<40%** |
| Boost CSAT | Avg. Time to Resolution | **<2 minutes** |
| Maintain Quality | CSAT Score | **≥ 4.5/5 stars** |

### 4. PRD Snippet: Human-in-the-Loop Escalation
**User Story**:  
_As a customer with a complex issue, when the AI cannot resolve my problem, I want to be seamlessly transferred to a human agent who already has the full context, so I don’t have to repeat myself._  

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Provide a clear **“Talk to a human”** option at all times.  
2. Auto-escalate if:  
   - Negative sentiment detected.  
   - Same question repeated 3x without resolution.  
3. Generate a **Handoff Brief** with:  
   - Problem summary  
   - Conversation transcript  
   - Customer data (e.g., order number)  
4. Prepend the **Handoff Brief** to a **Zendesk ticket** for smooth agent takeover.
